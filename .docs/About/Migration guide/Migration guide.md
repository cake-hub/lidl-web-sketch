# Migration guide

## Update version 4.x to 5.x

### New Git Repositories

- All CAKE library files are now at home in the Git repositories of Azure DevOps.

### Global file renaming

- The name of **LIDL CAKE UI Core** has been changed to **LIDL CAKE UI Fundamental** due to the new library setup of some Lidl Digital's CI elements.
- The new LIDL CAKE UI Fundamental library only consists of symbols, text- and layer-styles that are *fundamental* to each of our product.

### Symbol transfer

- Some symbols have been moved from our LIDL CAKE UI Fundamental library (earlier CORE) to their explicit product library files (e.g. LIDL CAKE UI Web, App,â€¦).
- Verify that all the following symbols are linked to the correct Sketch library:
  - Buttons
  - Forms
  - Tables

### Symbol replacement

- The simple cookie alert no longer exists in our LIDL CAKE UI Web library.
- Please verify that you don't use the simple cookie alert anymore!
- Therefore replace the simple version with our current cookie alert.

## How to change the repository settings?

- Please update the linking to the repositories to get all the updates of our libraries.
