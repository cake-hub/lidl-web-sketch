## Overall styling

The Lidl Plus pricebox is a combination of different single elements:

1. [Pricebox / Offer](../../Components/Pricebox/Pricebox.md#overall-styling)
2. [Label / Info](../../Components/Pricebox/Pricebox.md#label)
3. [RRP / Positive](../../Components/Pricebox/Pricebox.md#discount)
4. [Basic quantity](../../Components/Pricebox/Pricebox.md#basic-quantity)

## Recommendations

- You have to create the complete pricebox out of the **Lidl Plus pricebox**, **rrp** and **basic quantity** symbol due to a Sketch rescaling problem.

---

## Spacing & measurements

- All the single spacing and measurements for every component can be found under the standard [pricebox](../../Components/Pricebox/Pricebox.md#spacing--measurements).
