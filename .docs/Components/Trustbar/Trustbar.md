# Trustbar

The trustbar is a possibility to show unique selling propositions, services or other outstanding benefits of the company. The standard position on a website is right above the footer.

---

## Recommendations

- Use only one word or a short single line of text.
- There is no multiline.
- Please ensure that the content meets this requirement.

---

## Overall styling

- The text-style is **basic**.
- The background-color always is **gray-lighter**.
- Default states icon- and text-color is **gray-darker**.
- The hover, focus and active state is also shown in gray-darker but the **mouse cursor changes into a link cursor (pointer)**.
- The icon and text are **aligned horizontally and vertically to the center**.
