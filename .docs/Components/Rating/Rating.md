## Spacing & measurements

- The height of the rating is **16px**.
- The width depends on the number of given ratings in the bracket.
- The rating component changes between LG and MD-XS breakpoint. The star icons remain the same size and only the rating number text style changes according to  the [basic text style](../../General/Typography/Typography.md#basic).

| Types | Attributes | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| Icon-size | 16px | ![icon-size](assets/measurements/star-size@1x.png) |
| Padding | 4px| ![padding](assets/measurements/padding@1x.png) |

---

## Behavior

The inside of the last star item can be filled from left to right based on percentages.
A rating can be interactive (e.g. on product detail page) or static (e.g. on product tile). If the rating is static the rating component has **no hover-focus state**.
