# To Top

Use this "button" to allow the customer to jump directly to the top of the page.

It is a sticky element that floats outside the layout.

---

## Overall styling

- The component has a rounded upper left and right corner of 2px.
- It uses the shadow-default.

| Types | Attributes | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| Default | background-color: basic-white<br>icon-color: gray-darker | ![to-top: default](assets/state/default@1x.png) |
| Hover / focus | background-color: brand-primary-base<br>icon-color: basic-white | ![to-top: hover-focus](assets/state/hover@1x.png) |

## Recommendations

- Extend the footer by 64px to provide enough space for the to-top-button at the end of a website (so elements will not be overlapped).
