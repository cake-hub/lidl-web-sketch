# Pricebox

The use of the consistent LIDL pricebox is an elementary part of our brand awareness.

The pricebox contains several obligatory and optional elements and is available in different color combinations due to different visualizations (basic, offer, lidl-plus, etc.).

---

## Recommendations

- If there is already a currency symbol in the price box no additional currency sign should be displayed in the recommended retail price or label.

## Our workflow in Sketch

- Use the "Overrides"-function to change the text.
- Enter the text first. Then adjust the width of the symbol.
- The color variants of the label can be selected in the complete pricebox via the "Overrides"-function.
- The discount has to be added manually as a symbol to the pricebox:
  - First change the height.
  - Second, place the discount in the middle with the corresponding padding.
  - Finally insert the text via the "Overrides"-function.
