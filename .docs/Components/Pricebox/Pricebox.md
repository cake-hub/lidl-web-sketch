# Pricebox

The use of the consistent Lidl pricebox is an elementary part of our brand awareness.

The pricebox contains several fix and optional elements and is available in different color combinations due to different visualizations (standard, offer, lidl-plus, etc.).

---

## Recommendations

- If there is already a currency symbol in the price box no additional currency sign should be displayed in the recommended retail price or label.

## Spacing & Measurements

- The height of the pricebox depends on the content and the additional components shown.
- The width of the pricebox depends on the content.
- The width of the label denpends on the content of the pricebox.
- The height of the label is fixed for a single-line text.
- **Exception!** Designers set the margins to 4px due to a Sketch software problem with different text block widths while **the development uses 2px**.

## Our workflow in Sketch

- Use the "Overrides"-function to change the text.
- Enter the text first. Then adjust the width of the symbol.
- The color variants of the label can be selected in the complete pricebox via the "Overrides"-function.
- The discount has to be added manually as a symbol to the pricebox:
  - First change the height.
  - Second, place the discount in the middle with the corresponding padding.
  - Finally insert the text via the "Overrides"-function.
