# Typography

The Lidl Font was developed for the various topics and applications of Lidl's brand communication and represents the brand values and the brand core on a typographical level.

It helps you to present your design and content as clearly and effectively as possible according to the Lidl standard.

---

## Typefaces

- The Lidl Font Condensed Pro looks **informative**, **useful** and **efficient**.
- In combination, they represent the variety of topics and actions and, at the same time, are **100% Lidl**.
- **Capital letters are not allowed**. The **only exceptions** are sections heads and buttons.
- All types of headings should primarily be used in **single line scenarios**.
- Use any base color of **brand-primary**, **danger**, **success**, **info** or **warning** as text color as long as it has a high contrast ratio in interaction with backgrounds.
