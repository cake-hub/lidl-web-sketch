# Icons

Icons are  an essential element of design and are also known as pictograms. They can stand individually, be displayed together, or be part of an element.

They support the understanding of an information or function. Symbols are easier to read than text. They are mainly used to identify a function. It can also be used as an infographic or illustration.

---

## General

- The appearance of the icon depends on the usage or context.
- There’s also a **positive** and **negative** version to layout on a light or dark background.
- Icons have an original size of **60x60px**.
- The size has to follow the **rule of 8** (8, 16, 24, 32, …).

---

## Usage

- Icons can be used for **status**, as **links**, as **navigation**,  to **support** another element (in alerts, buttons, input-fields, etc.) or as  **illustration**.

### Styling as link

- Icons with a link have the same styling as text-links – on light as well as dark background.

|---|---|---|
| default | icon-color: brand-primary-base | ![placeholder-default](assets/definition/link/placeholder-default@1x.png) |
| hover / focus | icon-color: brand-primary-darker | ![placeholder-hover](assets/definition/link/placeholder-hover@1x.png) |
| disabled | icon-color: brand-primary-light | ![placeholder-disabled](assets/definition/link/placeholder-disabled@1x.png) |

### Styling as status

- Informs about a changed status, for example the current items in the shopping cart.
- The number of items can be displayed by addons.

| States | Attributes | Image |
|---|---|---|

| hover / focus | icon-color: brand-primary-base | ![heart-active](assets/definition/status/heart-hover@1x.png) |
| active | icon-color: brand-primary-base<br>**but the icon gets "…-solid"** | ![heart-active](assets/definition/status/heart-active@1x.png) |
| disabled | icon-color: brand-primary-light | ![heart-disabled](assets/definition/status/heart-disabled@1x.png) |

### Styling as navigation

- Icons that specify a direction.
- Icons symbolizing the current location.

| States | Attributes | Image |
|---|---|---|
| default / active | icon-color: gray-darker  | ![arrow-right-default](assets/definition/navigation/arrow-right-default@1x.png) |
