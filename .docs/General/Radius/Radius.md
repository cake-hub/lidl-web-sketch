# Radius

Matching the corporate identity, the different radii generally always describe a formal language. They are derived from the typeface and icons to create a harmonious overall picture to the customer.

## Concept

1. Default corners with a 2px rounding
2. Special corners with a 10px rounding

## Usage

- Use the default corners for almost all elements. For example buttons, form fields, product tile, etc.
- Use the special corners sparingly for highlight elements. If the default corners don't stand out enough for the needs of your project.
