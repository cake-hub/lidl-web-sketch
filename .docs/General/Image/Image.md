# Images

These elements are used as placeholders in symbols or on mockups.

---

## Recommendations

- There is a lot to consider when selecting the appropriate image component.
- To make layouting with pictures easier, we recommend that the picture symbols follow our 8pt grid - both in width and height.
- Furthermore, the sample content should always be adapted to the appropriate aspect ratio.
- You shouldn't use too many different image formats in one layout, as fewer image formats are better suited for use in design, production and website performance.


<div className="table-responsive">
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>Ratio</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Free ratio</td>
            <td>
                * The image scales as large as possible
                * Use this format for almost all UX elements or background images
                * Height and width can be random but must always be divisible by 8
            </td>
            <td>![logo: image free ratio](assets/free-ratio@1x.png)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4:3 ratio</td>
            <td>
                * Can only be used in a ratio of 4:3
                * Mainly used for product images or teasers
                * The fixed aspect ratio also ensures that the images look
                * the same everywhere and, for example, are not cropped.
            </td>
            <td>![logo: image 4:3](assets/4-3-ratio@1x.png)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

## What can be modified?

- Override the content.
- Adjust the ratio (only "free-ratio" symbol).
- Adjust height and width.

### Our workflow in Sketch

- These symbols are always placeholders.
- These placeholders can later easy be replaced by inserting sample content images.
- To set an image, use the "Overrides" function "Choose Image".
