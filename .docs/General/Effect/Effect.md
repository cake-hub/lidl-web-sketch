# Effects

Effects can be used to highlight individual elements.

Shadows visualize a spatial impression. They mark elements from their environment. They can also be used to display interactivity.

Overlays emphasize the contents above it and further hide not relevant information.

The browser focus shows the element what is currently focused.
